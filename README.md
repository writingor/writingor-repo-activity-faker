# Writingor Repo Activity Faker

## Did you just create your GitHub account a minute ago?

No problem!

The program will create files and immediately commit them locally at a specific random date and time. It will continue doing this until the current date.

## Usage

1. **Create a private repo**  
2. **Clone your repo**  
3. **Place this program `writingor-repo-activity-faker.sh` into your repo**
4. **Change the `first_commit_date`, `last_commit_date`, `chance_create_commit_in_current_day` and `amount_of_commits` to whatever you want**
5. **Update script premission `chmod +x ./writingor-repo-activity-faker.sh`**
6. **Run the script `./writingor-repo-activity-faker.sh`**
7. **Push the created files to your repo `git push`**

**Enjoy your "hard developer's work" activity!**

## Note

1. Of course, make sure that **"Show activity from private repositories"** is enabled in your GitHub settings.
2. A large number of files could be overwhelming for GitHub. It's better to **upload your files in smaller portions**, perhaps by delivering them over 2 or 3 years.
